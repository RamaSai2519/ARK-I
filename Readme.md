### ARK (Adaptive Resource Kernel)

ARK is an implementation of model resourcing based on user query where the primary model has the entire chat and decides which sub-model to ask for the relevant information required by the user. These sub-models' lifetime is short-lived, whereas the primary model's lifetime is long-lived and has the entire context in a summarized way.

This repository will contain the first iteration of the above idea.
