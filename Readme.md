### ARK (Adaptive Resource Kernel)

ARK is an implementation of model resourcing based on user query where the main model has the entire chat and decides which sub-model to ask for the relevant information required by the user. These sub-model's lifetime is short-lived whereas the main model's lifetime is long-lived and has the entire context in a summarized way.

This repository will contain the first iteration of above idea.
